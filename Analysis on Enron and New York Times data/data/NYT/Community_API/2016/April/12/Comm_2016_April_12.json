One reason:  gag provisions in separation contracts.<br/><br/>To obtain their severance and benefits, employees are forced to sign contracts in which they promise not to disclose the terms of their settlements and, further, not to \"disparage\" their former employers.  Disparagement doesn't merely mean defamation; the employees give up the right to criticize their employer in any way that might harm his business, a provision that is broadly interpreted to include all comments regarding what the employee may have believed to be illegal discrimination.  Moreover, the contracts also contains provisions that declare, in advance, that any breach of the agreement will \"irreparably harm\" (a legal term) the employee.  The employee is effectively silenced by such contracts.<br/><br/>First, gag orders and non-disparagement clauses should be nullified as coercive. Even when represented by counsel, employees usually have no choice but to sign, because they need severance pay and medical benefits. The provisions are one-sided, and unfair.<br/><br/>Second, such clauses should be declared void as a matter of public policy. As these posts demonstrate, we need to hear from victims -- and from one another -- that age discrimination is pervasive, pernicious and deadly.

The first bars of \u2018Life On Mars?\u2019 caught my ear as soon as I entered the store\u2026 and they never let go. At that stage I could barely understand basic English, and was way too young to fully grasp the lyrics, but something about the song moved me to head straight for the DJ booth and meekly ask for the album. <br/><br/>When I proudly emerged from the store, with an empty velcro wallet in my pocket but an imported vinyl pressing of Hunky Dory held firmly between my grubby little hands, I felt the rush of having done something by myself, something grownups did on a regular basis. It felt good. My parents were horrified. My dad scolded me for wasting money on \u201cstupid rock music\u201d, my mom wanted to take me to church as soon as she found out that the curious-looking being on the album art was actually a dude. Thankfully the store had a strict \u201cno refunds policy\u201d, so my record was confiscated for a few days until I managed to get it back from its hiding place. In the end, David Bowie found a way to stay with me. I guess you can say he taught me more about English, music, tolerance, originality, uniqueness and independence than my parents ever could.

The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from nature as from habit, custom, and education.

More importantly, I don't need \"accommodation\" from others because of the baby. We all have work to do, and I don't need anyone to do anything differently just because of I have a baby, as that would not be fair to them. <br/><br/>Still, I'm thankful for how open-minded and understanding my colleagues and boss were, and now, all these men can see for themselves a different world in which women with children can do the work just as well, and more. That first year allows me time to look for other options of childcare (which we eventually opted for group daycare), the time to bond with my baby, all without sacrificing my career.<br/><br/>It takes open-mindedness, and it might not be for everyone's situation (including job type, baby health and temperament).

If the price continues to drop, the more costly wells will be capped.  Uplift costs in Saudi Arabia average around $10, so it is to the Saudi's benefit to keep producing as that helps its national budget (but the benefit is far less than before due the price decline).<br/><br/>The high cost of crude in 2008 was caused in part by \"paper oil,\" traders who neither produced nor consumed crude and were purely speculators.  Changes in regulation and exchange rules have greatly reduced the level of paper oil traded.  That is one, but not the only, reason for the decline in the price of oil.

Will a quota calm your heart, ease your pain? If seeking love and recognition is the game, hatred and anger are ultimately an ill conceived strategy whether you are black, brown, cream, ochre, yellow, alabaster or white, with or without privilege.

They want what they want for members of the tribes they favor, and that's it. <br/><br/>In my line of work, academia, in the absence of such a law, we routinely bend over backwards to hire female and minority graduate students with little or no teaching or publishing experience over highly accomplished white male PhD's for the few tenure track jobs that even exist any more. If the ads simply said, e.g., \"no white males need apply, we already have people who look like you,\" at least it would be honest. We would no longer be treating people as we would never consent to be treated ourselves - being unemployed, seeing a job we'd love to have, getting our hopes up, putting great time and effort into applying for it, not knowing the whole time that we have no chance of getting it because of the race and/or gender into which we were born. <br/><br/>If Ms. Gay is going to insinuate that social justice demands proportional representation by race and ethnicity across the board, I look forward to her advocacy of such a law.

It says nothing about taxes, costs, etc.  You need to tell us how taxes would be affected.  At present, if I remember correctly, the U.S. government pays the lion's share of health care costs.  (Maybe that lion's share includes state government expenditures also.)  So, if $2000p.c. is added to the government funds available for health care, the government funds should be approximately equal to total present U.S. spending on health care.  In other words, your proposal (which I agree isn't politically possible) would enable the government(s) here to take over all health care without raising taxes.<br/><br/>That is the conclusion I get.

(And I say \"allegedly\" on the \"free\" checkups because they've never actually paid for any checkup.)  And even if they do pay one red cent, it's after they \"claim\" that the health costs were too high (not a \"customary\" charge) and cut them down to about 25% of what was actually charged so I have to pay the \"overcharge\", and then they expect me to pay 20% of the 25% of what they actually did pay (if they don't find some other way to weasel out of that too).

Incredibly excited for the future. Let's not give into the fear and the mediocrity of pragmatism.

Houghton et al, 1990, estimate a natural input and output exchange of 150 gigatons per year. <br/><br/>Houghton also estimates 10 gigatons of carbon emitted annually into the atmosphere by human activities (ref Houghton, R.A. 2008, Carbon dioxide Inf. Anal. Cent., Oak Ridge Natl. Lab, Oak Ridge, Tenn) <br/><br/>10/150 = 6.6%. So Houghton thinks 94% of CO2 flux is naturally occurring. \"Far in excess\" seems to fit pretty well. <br/><br/>Revelle &amp; Seuss (Tellus, vol. 9, pp 18-27, 2957) calculated that the amount of atmospheric CO2 due to human activities was 1.2 to 1.7% of the total.<br/><br/>Jaworowski, Z (EIR Science, Mar 16, 2007, pp38-53) reckons that \"97%  of the total annual emission of CO2 into the atmosphere comes from natural emissions of the land and sea: human beings add a mere 3%. this man-made 3% of CO2 emissions is responsible for a tiny fraction of the total greenhouse effect, probably close to 0.12%\"<br/><br/>So CO2 is indeed produced by natural sources \"far in excess\" of man-made sources.

Clinton, alas, is the candidate of the Democratic party establishment, which means that that establishment too stands firmly for letting inequality continue to increase, as do those in the academy and media like Paul Krugman who support Clinton over Sanders.

But consider that a price on fossil-derived carbon would in effect do the research for you.  <br/><br/>By attaching a cost to fossil fuels, in proportion to the amount of CO2 they release when combusted, the suppliers of fossil fuels and of goods which are fossil fuel intensive to produce will have to incorporate the increased cost into their products, if they want to stay in business.  No economic research is needed since the full-cycle environmental costs would be incorporated into pricing.  That would steer small and large decisions of what to buy and where to invest.    <br/><br/>As a policy prescription, this is about as good as it gets - it steers the economy into more sustainable technologies in a way which naturally incorporates the full-cycle climate (CO2) impacts which your post raises. Given the risks which increasing atmospheric CO2 poses to the climate of the only planet we have, it's critical that we reward the best technologies for the long run by adopting some form of pricing of fossil carbon.

And the effects of that stimulus has long since evaporated.<br/><br/>By the way, did you know that currently most government spending is directed into Republican/conservative states? In Mississippi, for example, literally 47% of the state's annual budget is in fact paid for by Federal tax dollars. The not-liberal Tax Foundation has several times over the last decade detailed how progressive states actually pay far more in Federal tax dollars than they receive in any Federal spending, causing a net loss of billions. Simultaneously, conservative states receive far more in Federal spending than they ever pay in Federal tax dollars, giving them a net gain, thanks to progressives.<br/><br/>And I assume you didn't actually read the column, as conservatives rarely do. Quite clearly, Dr. Krugman pointed out that the Keynesian economic principle is that you implement austerity (aka pay down the debt) at the economic boom times, but you borrow and spend during the slump to boost the economy. Note too, under Clinton we were doing exactly that, quite well. Remember the paid off debt predictions in 2000?

At the same time, \"subjectivity\" is governed by universal truths, whether we are aware of them or not.<br/><br/>I would think that what is most problematic is not increased \"objectivity\" but, rather, the confusion of \"objectivity\" and \"subjectivity\" or, perhaps, the cloaking of subjectivity in the mantle of objectivity. It has become common to to take claims of hope, fear, belief, and faith and state them as facts, as objective truths. We see this not merely in the current political environment but also in everyday life in such \"controversies\" as vaccines and anthropogenic global warming. <br/><br/>In a previous age, science had to be cloaked in faith.

The only question will be whether the Big 10 recognizes that by taking UConn they preemptively lock up the Northeast.

One thing I learned from him is that activating your culture before you use it gives the best results- so take a cup out of your mother culture from the refrigerator, add a cup of flour and a half cup of spring or distilled (NOT city tap water), mix it and let it rise at room temperature (or a little higher if possible - 75-80 degrees) until it rises and froths (and it may overflow your bowl)- at that point the culture is maximally active, and if you use it to make dough it will cause it to rise very briskly and make great bread.", "lft": 110, "userURL": "NULL", "createDate": "1458707030", "statusID": 2, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "recommendationCount": 7, "replies": {"comments": [{"userTitle": "NULL", "status": "approved", "replyCount": 0, "commentID": 17976184, "commentSequence": 17976184, "approveDate": "1458743294", "editorsSelection": false, "userDisplayName": "Rasta Tev", "userID": 67815815, "recommendedFlag": 0, "commentBody": "I have never been able to get a decent rise out of a sourdough starter even though I've had some supposedly well-established or even commercially available starters... thoughts, help?", "trusted": 0, "recommendations": 0, "userURL": "NULL", "createDate": "1458719327", "updateDate": "1458739694", "depth": 1, "parentUserDisplayName": "truthyone", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "replies": [], "commentType": "userReply", "userLocation": "Massachusetts", "parentID": 17975637}, {"userTitle": "NULL", "status": "approved", "replyCount": 0, "commentID": 17981754, "commentSequence": 17981754, "approveDate": "1458752950", "editorsSelection": false, "userDisplayName": "truthyone", "userID": 2941247, "recommendedFlag": 0, "commentBody": "The only thing I can suggest is making sure you are proofing at an adequate temperature.

They did &amp; were asked to lead a study committee of Maglev &amp; transportation experts,  The report made a convincing case that a Maglev transport network capable of carrying both trucks &amp; passengers at an average speed of 300 mph and also capable of electronic switching and operating on conventional railroads on Maglev adapted railroad tracks should be our next surface transport system to add capacity to our aging, costly and congested Interstate Highway System.
