Why don't we hear more about these pernicious practices and their victims?  One reason:  gag provisions in separation contracts.<br/><br/>To obtain their severance and benefits, employees are forced to sign contracts in which they promise not to disclose the terms of their settlements and, further, not to \"disparage\" their former employers.  Disparagement doesn't merely mean defamation; the employees give up the right to criticize their employer in any way that might harm his business, a provision that is broadly interpreted to include all comments regarding what the employee may have believed to be illegal discrimination.  Moreover, the contracts also contains provisions that declare, in advance, that any breach of the agreement will \"irreparably harm\" (a legal term) the employee.  The employee is effectively silenced by such contracts.<br/><br/>First, gag orders and non-disparagement clauses should be nullified as coercive. Even when represented by counsel, employees usually have no choice but to sign, because they need severance pay and medical benefits. The provisions are one-sided, and unfair.<br/><br/>Second, such clauses should be declared void as a matter of public policy. As these posts demonstrate, we need to hear from victims -- and from one another -- that age discrimination is pervasive, pernicious and deadly.

The first bars of \u2018Life On Mars?\u2019 caught my ear as soon as I entered the store\u2026 and they never let go. At that stage I could barely understand basic English, and was way too young to fully grasp the lyrics, but something about the song moved me to head straight for the DJ booth and meekly ask for the album. <br/><br/>When I proudly emerged from the store, with an empty velcro wallet in my pocket but an imported vinyl pressing of Hunky Dory held firmly between my grubby little hands, I felt the rush of having done something by myself, something grownups did on a regular basis. It felt good. My parents were horrified. My dad scolded me for wasting money on \u201cstupid rock music\u201d, my mom wanted to take me to church as soon as she found out that the curious-looking being on the album art was actually a dude. Thankfully the store had a strict \u201cno refunds policy\u201d, so my record was confiscated for a few days until I managed to get it back from its hiding place. In the end, David Bowie found a way to stay with me. I guess you can say he taught me more about English, music, tolerance, originality, uniqueness and independence than my parents ever could.

The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from nature as from habit, custom, and education.

Social inequality, a hierarchical social order is not, and increasingly it is morally intolerable.

My boss and colleagues and I go about our work without any interruptions. (I should say too that I'm blessed with a baby that doesn't fuss or cry much, he's a happy baby.) I might also be blessed for the fact that I could almost always have the ladies bathroom all by myself for pumping breast milk or changing diapers. More importantly, I don't need \"accommodation\" from others because of the baby. We all have work to do, and I don't need anyone to do anything differently just because of I have a baby, as that would not be fair to them. <br/><br/>Still, I'm thankful for how open-minded and understanding my colleagues and boss were, and now, all these men can see for themselves a different world in which women with children can do the work just as well, and more. That first year allows me time to look for other options of childcare (which we eventually opted for group daycare), the time to bond with my baby, all without sacrificing my career.<br/><br/>It takes open-mindedness, and it might not be for everyone's situation (including job type, baby health and temperament).

If the price continues to drop, the more costly wells will be capped.  Uplift costs in Saudi Arabia average around $10, so it is to the Saudi's benefit to keep producing as that helps its national budget (but the benefit is far less than before due the price decline).<br/><br/>The high cost of crude in 2008 was caused in part by \"paper oil,\" traders who neither produced nor consumed crude and were purely speculators.  Changes in regulation and exchange rules have greatly reduced the level of paper oil traded.  That is one, but not the only, reason for the decline in the price of oil.

Will a quota calm your heart, ease your pain? If seeking love and recognition is the game, hatred and anger are ultimately an ill conceived strategy whether you are black, brown, cream, ochre, yellow, alabaster or white, with or without privilege.

They want what they want for members of the tribes they favor, and that's it. <br/><br/>In my line of work, academia, in the absence of such a law, we routinely bend over backwards to hire female and minority graduate students with little or no teaching or publishing experience over highly accomplished white male PhD's for the few tenure track jobs that even exist any more. If the ads simply said, e.g., \"no white males need apply, we already have people who look like you,\" at least it would be honest. We would no longer be treating people as we would never consent to be treated ourselves - being unemployed, seeing a job we'd love to have, getting our hopes up, putting great time and effort into applying for it, not knowing the whole time that we have no chance of getting it because of the race and/or gender into which we were born. <br/><br/>If Ms. Gay is going to insinuate that social justice demands proportional representation by race and ethnicity across the board, I look forward to her advocacy of such a law.

It says nothing about taxes, costs, etc.  You need to tell us how taxes would be affected.  At present, if I remember correctly, the U.S. government pays the lion's share of health care costs.  (Maybe that lion's share includes state government expenditures also.)  So, if $2000p.c. is added to the government funds available for health care, the government funds should be approximately equal to total present U.S. spending on health care.  In other words, your proposal (which I agree isn't politically possible) would enable the government(s) here to take over all health care without raising taxes.<br/><br/>That is the conclusion I get.

(And I say \"allegedly\" on the \"free\" checkups because they've never actually paid for any checkup.)  And even if they do pay one red cent, it's after they \"claim\" that the health costs were too high (not a \"customary\" charge) and cut them down to about 25% of what was actually charged so I have to pay the \"overcharge\", and then they expect me to pay 20% of the 25% of what they actually did pay (if they don't find some other way to weasel out of that too).  How do they know what \"customary\" charges should be?  UnitedHealthcare owns the corporation that decides what \"customary\" charges should be.  So a health insurance corporation decides what's a fair amount for health insurance corporations to pay the doctors, hospitals and clinics.

Incredibly excited for the future. Let's not give into the fear and the mediocrity of pragmatism.

Houghton et al, 1990, estimate a natural input and output exchange of 150 gigatons per year. <br/><br/>Houghton also estimates 10 gigatons of carbon emitted annually into the atmosphere by human activities (ref Houghton, R.A. 2008, Carbon dioxide Inf. Anal. Cent., Oak Ridge Natl. Lab, Oak Ridge, Tenn) <br/><br/>10/150 = 6.6%. So Houghton thinks 94% of CO2 flux is naturally occurring. \"Far in excess\" seems to fit pretty well. <br/><br/>Revelle &amp; Seuss (Tellus, vol. 9, pp 18-27, 2957) calculated that the amount of atmospheric CO2 due to human activities was 1.2 to 1.7% of the total.<br/><br/>Jaworowski, Z (EIR Science, Mar 16, 2007, pp38-53) reckons that \"97%  of the total annual emission of CO2 into the atmosphere comes from natural emissions of the land and sea: human beings add a mere 3%. this man-made 3% of CO2 emissions is responsible for a tiny fraction of the total greenhouse effect, probably close to 0.12%\"<br/><br/>So CO2 is indeed produced by natural sources \"far in excess\" of man-made sources.
