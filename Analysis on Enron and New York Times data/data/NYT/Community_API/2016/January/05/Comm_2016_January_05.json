Why don't we hear more about these pernicious practices and their victims?  One reason:  gag provisions in separation contracts.<br/><br/>To obtain their severance and benefits, employees are forced to sign contracts in which they promise not to disclose the terms of their settlements and, further, not to \"disparage\" their former employers.  Disparagement doesn't merely mean defamation; the employees give up the right to criticize their employer in any way that might harm his business, a provision that is broadly interpreted to include all comments regarding what the employee may have believed to be illegal discrimination.  Moreover, the contracts also contains provisions that declare, in advance, that any breach of the agreement will \"irreparably harm\" (a legal term) the employee.  The employee is effectively silenced by such contracts.<br/><br/>First, gag orders and non-disparagement clauses should be nullified as coercive. Even when represented by counsel, employees usually have no choice but to sign, because they need severance pay and medical benefits. The provisions are one-sided, and unfair.<br/><br/>Second, such clauses should be declared void as a matter of public policy. As these posts demonstrate, we need to hear from victims -- and from one another -- that age discrimination is pervasive, pernicious and deadly.
